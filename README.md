# Namely
Namely is a baby name brainstorm engine. The purpose of Namely is to simply the process of naming one's child by providing parents with simple means of storing and analyzing names each spouse likes. Namely seeks to alleviate stress from parents who have a full plate. The names will have associated meanings, statistics, and pronunciations. Namely will never contain ads, misinformation, or cost anything more than the time it takes to download.

# Vision
Namely..

# Technology
* Mobile Developmnent:  ~Xamarin~ Android
* Web Development:      (?)
* Desktop Development:  Eletron (?)

# Misc
* Abandoning Xamrin. To be short, I don't like the technology and honestly have little desire to release anything on iOS. I need to get some practice in with Java as it is.
